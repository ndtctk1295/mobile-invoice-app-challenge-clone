# Repo root .gitignore
# This repository keeps the actual project inside the `my-app/` directory.
# Ignore everything at repo root, then explicitly re-include `my-app/` so
# all source files are tracked from that directory. Let `my-app/.gitignore`
# handle ignores local to the project (node_modules, .expo, etc.).

# Ignore everything
/*

# But keep this file
!.gitignore

# Re-include the project directory and all its contents
!/my-app/
!/my-app/**

# Keep designs folder (do not ignore)
!/designs/
!/designs/**

# Small sensible top-level ignores that are not part of the project source
